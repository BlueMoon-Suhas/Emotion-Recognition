# Emotion-Recognition

Emotions are expressed in several different ways, each emotion vary by unique
experiences, and understandings. So, to understand emotions conveyed, a capable
mechanism that is capable of modeling and capturing different language emotions is
needed. In this we propose a model to predict the emotions in a studentâ€™s speech or
text message. Taking our model as a multi-class classification model, we compare
two models. The features which are extracted are used to train different ML
classifiers, and and LSTM classifier is trained using the same features. We extracted
features from text data, features from speech data and concatenated both the models
to make a multi-modal that classifies both speech and text data.
